# Interactive-Form-with-Hidden-Elements

## Description
This is an interactive web page designed using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The page features a navigation bar, a form, and hidden elements that are manipulated through JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:

1. **HTML Structure**: 
    - A navigation bar with a list of items, some of which are initially hidden.
    - A form section where users can input their first name and last name.

2. **CSS3 and HTML5 Integration**: 
    - The navigation bar and form are styled using HTML5 and CSS3 conventions.

3. **JavaScript Functionality (jQuery)**:
    - On document ready, elements with the class `.e` are hidden.
    - The total number of input elements in the form is counted and appended to the body.
    - When the button with the ID `#s` is clicked, the values entered in the form (first name and last name) are appended to the body as new content.

### Features:
- **Hidden Elements**: Uses jQuery to hide and show elements dynamically.
- **Form Interaction**: Gathers user input from the form and displays it on the page.
- **Dynamic Content Update**: Updates the webpage content without refreshing, using jQuery for a smoother user experience.
